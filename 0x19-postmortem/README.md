## Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

### Issue Summary:
Duration: May 15, 2023, 10:00 AM - May 15, 2023, 11:30 AM (UTC)
Impact: The user authentication service experienced a complete outage, rendering users unable to log in or access their accounts. Approximately 30% of the user base was affected during the incident.

### Timeline:
- 10:00 AM: The issue was detected through monitoring alerts indicating a high number of failed login attempts.
- Upon investigation, it was observed that the login service response time was significantly slower than usual.
- Assumptions were made that the issue could be related to a database connectivity problem or a network issue.
- The incident was escalated to the DevOps team for further investigation and resolution.
- 10:30 AM: The DevOps team started investigating the database connectivity and network configurations as potential causes.
- Several misleading paths were taken, including reviewing recent code changes and analyzing the load balancer configurations.
- The incident was eventually escalated to the database administration team for their expertise.
- 11:00 AM: The database administration team identified a misconfigured network firewall rule that was blocking incoming traffic to the database servers.
- The firewall rule was promptly adjusted to allow the necessary connections, and the incident started to resolve.
- 11:30 AM: The user authentication service was restored, and users regained access to their accounts.

### Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was determined to be a misconfigured network firewall rule blocking incoming traffic to the database servers. This resulted in the authentication service being unable to establish connections to the database.

### Resolution:
The misconfigured firewall rule was corrected by updating the network configuration to allow the necessary connections between the authentication service and the database servers. This reestablished the communication flow and restored the service functionality.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures:
1. Review and improve the firewall management process to ensure proper configuration checks and regular audits to avoid similar misconfigurations.
2. Implement automated monitoring to promptly detect any firewall rule changes that could potentially impact critical services.
3. Conduct regular training sessions with the DevOps team to enhance troubleshooting skills and emphasize the importance of effective incident escalation.

### Tasks to Address the Issue:
1. Conduct a thorough review of the firewall rules across all critical systems and validate their correctness.
2. Implement automated configuration management tools to enforce standardized firewall configurations.
3. Enhance monitoring capabilities to include real-time alerts for any firewall-related issues or misconfigurations.
4. Schedule regular security and infrastructure audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, the web stack outage incident was caused by a misconfigured network firewall rule blocking communication between the authentication service and the database servers. The incident was resolved by correcting the firewall rule and restoring the necessary connections. To prevent similar incidents in the future, improvements in firewall management, monitoring, and team training will be implemented, along with specific tasks addressing the issue.

By analyzing the incident and implementing the suggested measures, we aim to enhance the overall stability and reliability of our web stack, ensuring a smoother user experience and minimizing service disruptions.
